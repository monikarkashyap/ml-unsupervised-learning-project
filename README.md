# machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
- Unsupervised Learning: perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involves four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.

### Project Description:
In this project, we will apply unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.
The data set for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store.

## Process
### Exploring: 
I start with deep diving into data to get the better understanding of the dataset. I start exploring the each column of the table and try to be more familiar with it. For this I use capabilities of python to understand the data. I also use Excel as our dataset is in .csv format.
### Cleaning:
Then I start with the cleaning process. Initially we start with the easy going cleaning which are easy to detect and fix. For example eliminating NULL valued rows. Python is a great tool to do that in no-time.
### Analysing:
I analyse only the numerical columns and exclude categorical columns from my analysis that includes:
  - Fresh 
  - Milk
  - Grocery
  - Frozen
  - Detergents_Paper
  - Delicassen
### Interesting Facts about data:
while working with this data I found some interesting outcomes.
- Milk, Grocery and Detergents_Pape are most likly to be brought together.
### Project Insites:
**I use two Algorithms for Feature Selection:**
- PCA
  **I use two Algorithms for Clustering**
- Kmeans
- Hierarchical
- PCA
### Future Goal:
If I could have more time I want to try more algorithms and also try to configure the best model. I also want to use some visualization tool like Tableau to explain my findings in effective way.

The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked.
### Challenges:
Time constraint is the biggest challenge for me for completing this project.
